### Tips for Usage

1. Start by creating a Tutor account. Enter some credentials and hit Register.
2. Once you've been logged in, you can go to the Profile tab and enter the rest of your information, including courses and avaliability. 
3. For avaliability, enter times with the following format: start with the 3 letter abreviation for the day followed by a space (Mon, Tue, etc...). After the space you can enter the starting hour of the time block. For example "Mon 9" represents Monday from 9 am to 10 am. All time blocks are one hour intervals. Also note that this is 24 hour time, so to represent Tuesday from 2 pm to 3 pm you would use "Tue 14", similarly Wednesday from 9 pm to 10 pm would be "Wed 21".
4. After you've filled out the Tutor's avaliability and course information, you can log out by force quitting the app. Do this by swiping the app to the side in the multitask dock. 
5. Once you force quit the app and open it again, you will be logged out. You can now register as a Tutee and login.
6. On the search page you can search for the Tutor you just created. Once you find the Tutor you can send a request. 
7. Once you've sent a request from the Tutee account, log out again by force quitting the app and log back in as the Tutor. You should see the request in the Requests tab. If you accept it, you will be shown the email of the Tutee. Similarly if you log back in as the Tutee you will see that your request has been accepted, and you can view the email of your Tutor.
